# Schloss Platform — Roadmap

Local planning note, survives across sessions on disk (not part of any
service's own git history). Full history was compressed out of this file
on 2026-08-04 — git log / closed issues+PRs/milestones in each repo are
the source of truth for what happened and why.

## Services (all public under `zudaR107`, AGPL-3.0)

- `schlussel` — auth/SSO (Hono API, RS256 JWT/JWKS, PKCE, invites+admin panel)
- `schloss` — home page / launcher
- `kuvert` — envelope budgeting
- `tafel` — tasks/projects (kanban, calendar, recurrence)
- `zettel` — markdown notes (wiki-links + backlinks done; tags and a
  Ctrl+K quick switcher still pending)
- `tor` — Caddy reverse-proxy gateway, single entry point, no host ports
  published by any other service
- `schloss-ui` — shared React component library
- `schloss-server-kit` — shared backend auth/CORS kit

**Status**: platform foundation (auth, CI/Docker/GHCR, gateway, shared
design system, SSO) and all 5 app repos' core feature sets are done and
merged. Nothing in progress — every repo's only open PRs are Dependabot.
Proposed but not started: a "small visual signature" pass (mascot
illustration + sidebar badge + one micro-animation per service) for
schlussel/kuvert/tafel, design already agreed, not yet built.

## Standing workflow (every stage)

- Milestone = umbrella of issues, not one-per-issue. One branch per
  milestone, one PR per repo from it into `main`.
- Labels: this repo's own `type:feat/fix/chore/test/docs` — check
  `gh label list` first, never assume.
- Project board `PVT_kwHOBhrZh84BctmC`, Status field
  `PVTSSF_lAHOBhrZh84BctmCzhXUW3s` (Todo `f75ad846` / In Progress
  `47fc9ee4` / Done `98236657`) — every issue/PR added, kept current.
- A fresh subagent with no implementation access writes tests from a
  behavioral spec; a separate docs agent updates README/OpenAPI when the
  API surface changes.
- Local git identity per repo must be `zudaR107 <zudin_daniil@mail.ru>`
  (check `.git/config`, not just global) — otherwise GitHub injects a
  Co-Authored-By trailer on squash-merge.
- PR: Conventional Commits title, `Closes #N`, same label/assignee/board
  status as its issue(s); merge via `gh pr merge` once CI is green;
  verify the merge commit has no Co-Authored-By line.
- After merge: delete the branch, set board items to Done, close the
  milestone.

## Repo locations

`/home/zudar/Sandbox/Hof/{schlussel,schloss,kuvert,tafel,zettel,tor,schloss-ui,schloss-server-kit}/`
— same names at `https://github.com/zudaR107/<name>`. This directory
itself is the `Hof` meta-repo (docs + submodule pins only, no CI, no
branch protection).
